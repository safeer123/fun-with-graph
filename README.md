# fun-with-graph

- This project primarily focuses to introduce fun with math functions by visualizing them as 2D graphs
- This app provides a cool Javascript function editor, where one can type in different math functions
- The output of the function is a graph rendered with dots, with X, Y axes OR polar coordinates r and theta (angle)
- More than just mathematics, use the full potential of the Javascript to build a 2D function
- Enjoy beautiful 2D graphs !! Try new ones !!
